# Fake News Detection Model

![Fake News Detection](fake-news-image.jpg)

## Overview

This project focuses on creating and evaluating multiple machine learning models for Fake News Detection using the Kaggle Fake News Dataset. The objective is to classify news articles as either fake or real. The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to determine the most effective model for detecting fake news.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Kaggle Fake News Dataset. It contains labeled news articles, indicating whether they are real or fake. The dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating fake news detection models.

## Project Contents

This project is organized into the following sections within a Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** In this section, the data is loaded and preprocessed. This includes cleaning, text processing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Techniques such as removing punctuation, stop words, and handling missing data are applied.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Text data is transformed into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization or Count Vectorization.

3. **Model Training:** A variety of machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest

4. **Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. A comparative analysis is performed to identify the best-performing model.

5. **Conclusion:** The project concludes by summarizing the findings, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and providing insights into which model is most effective for fake news detection.
